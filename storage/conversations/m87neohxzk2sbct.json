      "content": "# MCP Automation Project Summary\n\n## Project Overview\n\nThe MCP Automation project is building a task automation platform with the following capabilities:\n- Recording repetitive browser-based tasks using screen recording technology\n- Analyzing recordings to extract UI elements and user actions\n- Generating automation scripts based on the analysis\n- Executing these scripts using the OpenManus framework\n- Improving agent performance over time using OpenManus-RL\n\n### Key Components\n1. **Recording System** - Uses browser's MediaRecorder API to capture user actions\n2. **Analysis Engine** - Utilizes Gemini AI to understand UI interactions\n3. **Script Generation** - Creates OpenManus-compatible automation scripts\n4. **Execution System** - Executes the scripts using OpenManus\n5. **UI** - Interface for recording, analyzing, and monitoring tasks\n\n## Current Status\n\n### Major Achievements\n1. ✅ Integration strategy established using OpenManus as the foundation\n2. ✅ Screen recording functionality working with metadata management\n3. ✅ Gemini AI integration for video analysis working (replacing previous attempts with OmniParser/BLIP)\n4. ✅ Script generation creating valid OpenManus scripts\n5. ✅ Database schema updated to store scripts, analysis data, and execution metadata\n6. ✅ Tabbed UI interface for viewing analysis, editing scripts, and tracking executions\n\n### Recently Fixed Issues\n1. ✅ Fixed the database issue where script, last_analysis_method, and last_analyzed_at weren't being saved\n2. ✅ Fixed frontend issues with the Gemini analysis API response handling\n3. ✅ Improved UI to better represent the analyzed status and show appropriate action buttons\n4. ✅ Enhanced the status preservation by setting it in a single transaction\n5. ✅ Added better validation and debug logging to identify update issues",
